For q2, we modified the given distance function to track the instruction used for each cell
so that we could later use that information when visualizing the alignment. We created a visualize
function that the distance function calls, and it returns a array with the characters needed for the
alignment. The visualize function back-traces through the edit distance table and the instruction 
table, while adding information to the alignment array that corresponds to each instruction for the 
current cell. The only other function we created was printAlignment, which takes in an array containing
the characters of the alignment and prints them out in an aligned fashion. We did not use any additional 
resources for q2.
