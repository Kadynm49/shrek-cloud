Assignment 2 

We used the second strategy described in step to and replaced all words in the train.txt that had an occurence of 3 or fewer with <UNK>.
We moved the modified text into a new file called cleanedTrain.txt in order to lower the amount of time the program takes to read in train.txt 
and insert all of the <UNK> tokens. This means that cleanedTrain.txt is required for the program to run correctly, and the original train.txt 
file is no longer used. Make sure that cleanedTrain.txt and test.txt are in the same directory as assn2.py and it will run correctly

For generating sentences, we added some randomness to ensure that sentences don't often duplicate. Unigrams have a random length of each sentence, 
while bigram and trigram models choose the next word from the 5 most likely words to come after the current word.
